## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a **personal learning archive** created as I progress through the Udemy course *"Sıfırdan İleri Seviye C# Programlama"* (C# Programming from Scratch to Advanced).

- 🧩 **Every single line of code has been written manually** — there is absolutely **no copy-pasting** from the course or other sources.
- 🧠 The main purpose is to **practice and reinforce my understanding** of C# through hands-on development.
- 📘 It serves as **a learning log for myself** and potentially **a helpful reference for other students** following a similar path.
- 🔧 Includes **custom improvements and original solutions** beyond what is covered in the course.
